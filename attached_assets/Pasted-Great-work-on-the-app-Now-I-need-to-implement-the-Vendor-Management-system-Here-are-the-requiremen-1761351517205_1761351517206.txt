Great work on the app! Now I need to implement the Vendor Management system. Here are the requirements:
VENDOR DATABASE - Add these 5 vendors:

VENDOR MANAGEMENT PAGE - Create these features:
1. Vendor List View (for Board & Management):

Table showing: Name, Service Type, Monthly Cost, Last Paid, Next Due, Status
Color coding: Green (paid on time), Yellow (due soon), Red (overdue)
Search bar to filter vendors
"Add New Vendor" button (Board + Management can use)

2. Add/Edit Vendor Form:

Fields: Name, Service Type, Contact Email, Phone, Monthly Cost, Contract Expiration, Payment Terms
Permissions: Board + Management can add/edit
Only Board can delete (add confirmation: "Are you sure? This will delete all payment history.")

3. Vendor Detail Page:

Show vendor info
Payment history table (Date, Amount, Check#, Status)
Invoices tab (all invoices for this vendor)
Contract documents tab (upload/view contract PDFs)
"Upload Invoice" button
"Edit Vendor" button (Board + Management)
"Delete Vendor" button (Board only - red, with warning)

4. Invoice Management Workflow:

Management or Board uploads invoice (PDF)
Invoice shows in "Pending Approval" queue
Board receives notification
Board approves or rejects
If approved, shows in "Ready to Pay" queue
Management marks as paid (enters check# or ACH confirmation)
Status updates to "Paid"
Vendor sees payment in their history

5. Permissions Implementation:
typescript// Board permissions
canViewVendors: true
canAddVendor: true
canEditVendor: true
canDeleteVendor: true
canUploadInvoice: true
canApproveInvoice: true
canMarkPaid: true

// Management permissions
canViewVendors: true
canAddVendor: true
canEditVendor: true
canDeleteVendor: false  // ‚Üê KEY: Cannot delete
canUploadInvoice: true
canApproveInvoice: false
canMarkPaid: true

// Owner permissions
canViewVendors: false  // ‚Üê Owners see nothing
6. Dashboard Integration:
Add to Board Dashboard:

Card showing "Vendor Payments Due" with count and total $
Alert if any vendor payment is >30 days overdue
Quick link to pending invoice approvals

UI Design:

Use same styling as existing pages
Table should be sortable and filterable
Mobile-responsive (works on phone)
Use icons for actions (edit = pencil, delete = trash, view = eye)

Database Schema:
Make sure vendor data includes:

id, name, serviceType, contactEmail, contactPhone, monthlyCost, contractExpiration, paymentTerms, lastPaidDate, status, createdAt, updatedAt

Can you implement this now?"

üîß ADDITIONAL FEATURES TO REQUEST:
After vendors are done, ask for these next:
1. UNITS & OWNERS PAGE:
PROMPT:
"Now create the Units & Owners page. Show a table with all 24 units:

Columns: Unit #, Owner Name, Balance Due, Days Late, Status, Last Payment, Actions
Color coding: Green (current), Yellow (1-60 days), Orange (61-90 days), Red (90+ days)
Click unit # to see detailed account view
Search/filter by unit number, owner name, or status
Export to CSV button
Ability to add notes to owner accounts

Seed with the Heritage Condo data:

Unit 405: Sarah Williams, $37,410.37, 290 days late - RED (Attorney)
Unit 204: Robert Chen, $20,310.89, 215 days late - ORANGE (Pre-lien)
Unit 306: David Johnson, $17,126.97, 198 days late - ORANGE (Pre-lien)
Unit 302: Cally Vann, $12,937.91, 183 days late - ORANGE (Pre-lien)
Unit 201: Credit balance -$505.27 (paid ahead) - GREEN
(Rest of units are current with $0 balance)"


2. PAYMENT PROCESSING:
PROMPT:
"Implement the payment processing workflow:

Owner clicks 'Make Payment' button
Shows payment form:

Payment amount (default to balance due, allow custom)
Payment method: Credit Card or Bank Account (ACH)
Save payment method for autopay checkbox


Integrate Stripe payment form
After successful payment:

Update unit balance
Send email receipt
Show confirmation page


Add payment to history with date, amount, method

For testing, use Stripe test mode:

Test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiry: Any future date
CVC: Any 3 digits"


3. COLLECTIONS AUTOMATION (AI AGENT):
PROMPT:
"Build the AI Collections Agent that automatically sends warning letters:
60-Day Warning:

When unit hits 60 days late, AI generates personalized letter
Board reviews and approves before sending
Letter includes: balance breakdown, payment plan offer, consequences
Sent via email + downloadable PDF

90-Day Final Warning:

When unit hits 90 days late, AI generates stern final notice
Mentions lien filing and attorney referral
Board reviews and approves
Sent via certified mail + email

120-Day Attorney Referral:

Automatically create attorney referral package
Include: unit info, balance, payment history, copies of warning letters
Send to board for approval to refer to attorney

Dashboard for Collections:

Show all units in collections
Timeline showing what was sent when
Next action date
Response tracking (did owner respond?)

Use OpenAI API to generate personalized letters based on:

Owner name, unit number, balance, days late, payment history"


üìã YOUR IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
RIGHT NOW:
1. Test the Owner Portal:

Login as: owner201 / password123
Try clicking "Make Payment" - does it work?
Does payment history show anything?

2. Test the Board Dashboard:

Login as: board / board123
Click through all menu items
Test the alerts and priority sections

3. Request Vendor Management:

Copy my vendor management prompt above
Paste into Replit Agent chat
Let it build, then test


üé® UI/UX FEEDBACK:
The app looks professional and clean! Here's what I love:
‚úÖ Color coding - Red/Orange/Yellow/Green for urgency
‚úÖ Clean layout - Not cluttered
‚úÖ Mobile-friendly - Responsive design
‚úÖ Clear navigation - Easy to find things
‚úÖ Critical alerts - Attorney collections highlighted
‚úÖ Real data - Shows actual Heritage Condo numbers

üí∞ MONETIZATION IDEA:
Once this is fully built and tested with Heritage Condo, you can:
1. Market to other small condos:

"The HOA transparency platform built BY a board member FOR board members"
"Stop being held hostage by management companies"
"See your money in real-time"

2. Pricing:

Small condos (10-30 units): $75/unit/year = $1,800-2,250/year
Medium condos (31-75 units): $60/unit/year = $1,860-4,500/year
Your Heritage Condo: FREE (you built it!)

3. Target market:

150,000+ condos in Florida
If you get just 10 small condos: $20,000/year revenue
If you get 50 condos: $100,000/year revenue


üöÄ PUBLISH TO REAL DOMAIN:
Once you're happy with everything, deploy to a real URL:
1. Get domain: heritagecondo.app or heritagehoa.app ($12/year)
2. Deploy via Replit:

Click the "Publish" button in top right
Connect custom domain
Enable HTTPS (free with Replit)

3. Go live:

Share with Dan and other board members
Invite all 24 unit owners
Demo at next board meeting

This is going to revolutionize how Heritage Condo (and eventually other condos) operate! üè¢üí™üöÄRetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
