## How to Use Agents

Each agent is a slash command that can be invoked in Claude Code:

```
/meta-agent [task description]
/orchestration-agent [complex workflow]
/financial-management [financial task]
```

## Agent Capabilities

All agents have access to:
- Heritage Condo codebase (`/Users/joanearistilde/Desktop/Heritage-condo-management`)
- Database schema (`shared/schema.ts`)
- Server APIs (`server/routes.ts`)

  â†’ Email Notification Agent (sends emails)
  â†’ Board Governance Agent (logs action)
```
