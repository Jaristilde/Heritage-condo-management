## Security Best Practices for HOA Applications

### 1. Authentication Best Practices
- **Password Requirements**:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
  - No common passwords (check against breach databases)
  - Password expiration every 90 days for board members

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**:
  - Required for board members
  - Optional for owners
  - SMS, authenticator app, or email codes

- **Account Lockout**:
  - Lock after 5 failed attempts
  - 15-minute lockout period
  - Email notification to user
  - Admin unlock capability

### 2. Authorization Best Practices
- **Role Definitions**:
  ```
  owner: Can only view own unit data, make payments
  management: Can view all units, upload invoices, cannot approve
  board_member: Can approve invoices, view reports
  board_treasurer: Full financial access, cannot modify directly
  board_secretary: Admin access, user management
  ```

- **Resource Access Control**:
  ```
  GET /api/units/:id
  - Owner: Can only access own unit
  - Board: Can access any unit
  - Management: Can access any unit

  POST /api/invoices/:id/approve
  - Owner: FORBIDDEN
  - Management: FORBIDDEN
  - Board: ALLOWED
  ```

### 3. Data Encryption Best Practices
- **At Rest**:
  - AES-256 for database encryption
  - Encrypted database backups
  - Secure key storage (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault)

- **In Transit**:
  - TLS 1.2 or higher
  - Strong cipher suites only
  - HSTS headers enabled
  - Certificate pinning for mobile apps

### 4. API Security Best Practices
- **Rate Limiting**:
  ```
  Login endpoint: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
  Payment endpoint: 3 attempts per hour per user
  Public APIs: 100 requests per hour per IP
  Authenticated APIs: 1000 requests per hour per user
  ```

- **Security Headers**:
  ```
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
  X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  ```

### 5. Logging & Audit Trail
- **Security Events to Log**:
  - Login attempts (success and failure)
  - Password changes/resets
  - Role/permission changes
  - Financial transactions
  - Invoice approvals/rejections
  - Data exports
  - Failed authorization attempts
  - Account lockouts

- **Audit Trail Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-10-31T14:23:45Z",
    "event": "invoice_approval",
    "user_id": "usr_123",
    "user_role": "board_treasurer",
    "action": "approve",
    "resource": "invoice:inv_789",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "status": "success"
  }
  ```

### 6. Third-Party Security
- **Stripe Integration**:
  - Use Stripe.js (never handle card data directly)
  - Validate webhooks with signatures
  - Store only payment tokens, never card numbers
  - Enable 3D Secure for fraud prevention

- **Email Service**:
  - Use app-specific passwords
  - Rotate credentials quarterly
  - Monitor for suspicious sending activity
  - Implement SPF, DKIM, DMARC

## Incident Response Plan

1. **Detect**: Identify breach through monitoring/alerts
2. **Contain**: Immediately isolate affected systems
3. **Assess**: Determine scope, data affected, number of users
4. **Notify**: Inform affected owners within 72 hours
5. **Remediate**: Fix vulnerability, reset credentials
6. **Document**: Create incident report, lessons learned
