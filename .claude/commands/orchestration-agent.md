3. **Execute Workflow**: Spawn agents in correct sequence
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track each step, handle errors
5. **Aggregate Results**: Combine outputs from all agents
6. **Report Status**: Provide clear summary of workflow completion

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential (Each step depends on previous)
```
Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Step 4
```
Example: Invoice Approval → Email Notification → Board Action → Payment

### Pattern 2: Parallel (Steps can run simultaneously)
```
        ┌─ Step 2a ─┐
Step 1 ─┼─ Step 2b ─┼─ Step 3
        └─ Step 2c ─┘
```
Example: Send emails to multiple board members in parallel

### Pattern 3: Conditional (Steps depend on conditions)
```
Step 1 → [If condition A] → Step 2a
         [If condition B] → Step 2b
```
Example: If balance > $5000, escalate to attorney; else send notice

### Pattern 4: Loop (Repeat for multiple items)
```
For each unit:
  Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3
```
Example: Process assessments for all 24 units

## Error Handling

### Error Recovery Strategies
1. **Retry**: Try agent again (for transient errors)
2. **Fallback**: Use alternative approach
3. **Skip**: Mark as failed, continue workflow
4. **Abort**: Stop entire workflow
5. **Rollback**: Undo completed steps

### Example Error Handling
```
Invoice Approval Agent fails →
  ↓
Check error type:
  - Validation error → Report to user, abort
  - Email timeout → Retry once
  - Database error → Rollback, alert admin
```

## Workflow State Tracking

You maintain workflow state:
```json
{
  "workflowId": "monthly-close-2025-10",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "steps": [
    {"agent": "Financial Management", "status": "completed", "duration": "2.3s"},
    {"agent": "Delinquency Management", "status": "in_progress"},
    {"agent": "Reporting", "status": "pending"},
    {"agent": "Email Notification", "status": "pending"}

}
