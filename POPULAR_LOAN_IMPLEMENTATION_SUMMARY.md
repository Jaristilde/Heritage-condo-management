# Popular Loan Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Database Migration
- Created `report_imports` table for tracking import batches
- Created `popular_loans` table for storing loan data per unit
- Added indexes for performance: `idx_popular_loans_unit`, `idx_popular_loans_unit_created`, `idx_popular_loans_source`
- Created view `v_units_with_popular` for easy querying

### 2. Schema Updates
- Added `reportImports` table definition to `shared/schema.ts`
- Added `popularLoans` table definition to `shared/schema.ts`
- Created insert schemas: `insertReportImportSchema`, `insertPopularLoanSchema`
- Exported types: `ReportImport`, `PopularLoan`, `InsertReportImport`, `InsertPopularLoan`

## Remaining Tasks ðŸ“‹

### 3. Storage Layer (server/storage.ts)
Add these methods to the `IStorage` interface and `DbStorage` class:

```typescript
// Report Import operations
createReportImport(report: InsertReportImport): Promise<ReportImport>;
getReportImportsByVendor(vendor: string): Promise<ReportImport[]>;
getLatestReportImport(vendor: string, periodMonth?: number, periodYear?: number): Promise<ReportImport | undefined>;

// Popular Loan operations
createPopularLoan(loan: InsertPopularLoan): Promise<PopularLoan>;
upsertPopularLoan(loan: InsertPopularLoan): Promise<PopularLoan>;
getPopularLoansByUnit(unit: string): Promise<PopularLoan[]>;
getLatestPopularLoanByUnit(unit: string): Promise<PopularLoan | undefined>;
getAllPopularLoans(): Promise<PopularLoan[]>;
```

### 4. API Endpoints (server/routes.ts)
Add these routes:

```typescript
// GET /api/popular-loans - Get all latest popular loans
// GET /api/popular-loans/:unit - Get loan for specific unit
// POST /api/popular-loans/import - Import Popular Loan data
// GET /api/report-imports - Get all report imports
// GET /api/report-imports/:id - Get specific report import
```

### 5. Import UI Component (client/src/pages/import-popular-loans.tsx)
Create a new page with:
- File upload (CSV/XLSX)
- Period selector (Month/Year)
- Preview grid before commit
- Validation messages
- Success/error toasts

### 6. Update Units API
Modify `getAllUnits()` in storage.ts to join with `popularLoans`:
- Add fields: `loanNumber`, `popularStatus`, `popularBalance`, `popularLastPayment`

### 7. Update Units Page UI (client/src/pages/units.tsx)
Update the Popular Loan column to show:
- Status badges (OWES/PAID) with color coding
- Loan number when available
- Balance for OWES status
- Tooltip with last payment date

### 8. Owner Profile Enhancement
Add a "Popular Loan" card to the owner profile showing:
- Loan number
- Status
- Current balance
- Last payment date
- Link to source report

## Sample Data for Testing

```csv
Unit,Loan Number,Current Balance,Last Payment Date
202,PB-12345,5000.00,2025-01-15
205,PB-67890,0.00,2024-12-30
206,,0.00,
308,PB-88888,11920.92,2023-06-15
```

Expected UI Display:
- **Unit 202**: PB-12345 â€¢ Owes $5,000.00 (red badge "OWES")
- **Unit 205**: PB-67890 â€¢ PAID (green badge "PAID")
- **Unit 206**: PAID â€“ loan # not listed (grey badge)
- **Unit 308**: PB-88888 â€¢ Owes $11,920.92 (red badge "OWES")

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Continue with the storage layer implementation?
2. Create the API endpoints?
3. Build the import UI component?
4. Or work on another specific part?

Let me know which component you'd like me to implement next!
