## ‚úÖ PHASE 1: SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS - COMPLETED

### 1. Enhanced User Authentication Schema

**File:** `/shared/schema.ts`

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Added `mustChangePassword` field (forces password change on first login)
- ‚úÖ Added `loginAttempts` tracking (account locks after 5 failed attempts)
- ‚úÖ Added `lockedUntil` timestamp for account lockouts
- ‚úÖ Added `lastLoginAt` and `lastLoginIp` for security tracking
- ‚úÖ Added `passwordChangedAt` timestamp
- ‚úÖ Updated user roles to include: `super_admin`, `board_secretary`, `board_treasurer`, `board_member`, `management`, `owner`
- ‚úÖ All passwords are BCrypt hashed (strength: 12 rounds)

### 2. Activity Log for Security Events

**File:** `/shared/schema.ts`

**New Table:** `activity_log`

**Purpose:** Tracks all user actions and security events separately from data audit log

**Fields:**
- User ID, username (nullable for failed logins)
- Activity type: `login`, `logout`, `failed_login`, `password_change`, `account_locked`, `account_unlocked`
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Success/failure status with failure reasons
- Metadata for additional context

### 3. Secure User Seed Script

**File:** `/scripts/seed-secure-users.ts`

**Features:**
- Generates cryptographically secure 20-character passwords
- Requirements: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- Creates 3 initial users:
  1. `admin` - Super Administrator
  2. `board.secretary` - Board Secretary
  3. `board.treasurer` - Board Treasurer
- All users have `mustChangePassword=true`
- Displays credentials ONE TIME ONLY after seeding
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate users

**Run with:**
```bash
npm run seed:users
```

- Password validation:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - At least 1 uppercase letter
  - At least 1 lowercase letter
  - At least 1 number
  - At least 1 special character
- Visual checklist showing requirements

- Log activity to `activity_log`

### 2. Banking API with Florida Compliance

**File to Create:** `/server/routes/banking.ts`

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Update Database Schema

**IMPORTANT:** You need a valid DATABASE_URL before running migrations.

Current DATABASE_URL authentication is failing. You need to:

1. Get a fresh connection string from your Neon database dashboard
2. Update `.env.development` with the new DATABASE_URL
3. Run migrations:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

This will apply all schema changes:
- Enhanced users table with security fields
- Activity log table
- Enhanced bank accounts table
- Enhanced assessments table

### Step 2: Run Seed Scripts

After migrations complete successfully:

```bash
# Seed all data
npm run seed:all

# Or seed individually:
npm run seed:banks
npm run seed:assessments
npm run seed:users
```

**CRITICAL:** The `seed:users` script will display temporary passwords **ONE TIME ONLY**. Save them immediately in a secure password manager.

### Step 3: Update Production Environment

**Render (Backend):**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Render will auto-deploy
3. Run seed scripts in Render shell:
   ```bash
   npm run seed:all
   ```

**Netlify (Frontend):**
1. Will auto-deploy from GitHub
2. No additional steps needed
