# 🏢 Heritage Condo Management - Vision & Roadmap

## 🎯 Mission
Build a comprehensive, AI-powered HOA/Condo management system that completely replaces traditional accounting services, eliminates dependency on external bookkeepers, and provides intelligent financial automation for Heritage Condo.

## 💡 Core Problem
Heritage has had 5 different accountants who handled the accounting work horribly. This app will be the permanent solution - a self-sufficient system that board members and management can trust.
