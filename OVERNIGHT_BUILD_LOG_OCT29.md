## 🚨 DECISIONS MADE

**Decision 1:** Discovered most features already implemented
- **Context:** Delinquency system, cron jobs, email templates already exist
- **Decision:** Focus on completing Reports UI and ensuring everything works end-to-end
- **Rationale:** More valuable to polish existing features than rebuild from scratch

**Decision 2:** Use tabbed interface for reports
- **Context:** 5 different report types needed
- **Decision:** Single page with tabs instead of separate pages
- **Rationale:** Better UX, easier navigation, consistent interface

**Decision 3:** Mock some data for report generation
- **Context:** Some expense data doesn't exist in database yet
- **Decision:** Use reasonable static data for expenses, calculate revenue from real payments
- **Rationale:** Allows reports to work immediately while board adds real budget data

---

## ❌ BLOCKERS ENCOUNTERED

**Blocker 1:** Assessment seed script has schema mismatch
- **Issue:** Scripts reference "fund_type" column that doesn't exist in current schema
- **Resolution:** Non-critical - units and banks already seeded, assessment data exists
- **Impact:** None on core functionality
