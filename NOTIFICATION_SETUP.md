## Part 3: Add Phone Numbers to User Accounts

### Step 1: Update Database Schema

1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to project directory:

   npm run db:push
   ```

4. If prompted about "accounts table", select **+ accounts create table** (first option)
5. Press Enter to apply changes

### Step 2: Add Phone Numbers via Database

You need to add Joane and Dan's phone numbers directly to the database:

**Option A: Using Database GUI (Neon Console)**

1. Go to https://console.neon.tech/
2. Select your project: **Heritage Condo Management**
3. Click **SQL Editor** tab
4. Run this SQL to add Joane's phone:
   ```sql
   UPDATE users
   SET phone = '+1XXXXXXXXXX', sms_notifications = true
   WHERE username = 'joane';
   ```

5. Run this SQL to add Dan's phone:
   ```sql
   UPDATE users
   SET phone = '+1XXXXXXXXXX', sms_notifications = true
   WHERE username = 'danward';
   ```

6. Verify it worked:
   ```sql
   SELECT username, email, phone, sms_notifications
   FROM users
   WHERE role IN ('board_secretary', 'board_treasurer', 'board_member');
   ```

**Option B: Using API Endpoint (Coming Soon)**

We'll add a user profile page where Joane and Dan can add their own phone numbers.

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending

   - `SMTP_PASS` = 16-character app password (no spaces)
   - `SMTP_HOST` = `smtp.gmail.com`
   - `SMTP_PORT` = `587`

3. Check Render logs for errors:
   - Go to Logs tab
   - Look for `‚ùå Failed to send invoice approval notification`
   - If you see this, check your Gmail app password

4. Verify Gmail app password is still valid:
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - If the app password is revoked, create a new one

### SMS Not Sending

**Problem**: No SMS received after invoice upload

**Solutions**:
1. **Trial Account Verification**:
   - Verify both Joane and Dan's phone numbers in Twilio Console
   - Go to **Verified Caller IDs** ‚Üí Add both numbers

2. **Check Twilio Balance**:
   - Go to Twilio Console dashboard
   - Check if you have trial credit remaining
   - Each SMS costs ~$0.0075

3. **Check Phone Number Format**:
   - Must be E.164 format: `+1XXXXXXXXXX` (with +1)
   - Example: `+17865551234`

4. **Check Render Logs**:
   - Look for: `üì± SMS notifications sent to 2 board members`
   - If you see errors, check Twilio credentials in Render

5. **Verify `sms_notifications` is enabled**:
   - Run this SQL in Neon:
   ```sql
   SELECT username, phone, sms_notifications FROM users WHERE username IN ('joane', 'danward');
   ```
   - Both should have `sms_notifications = true`

### Both Email and SMS Not Working

**Problem**: No notifications at all

**Solutions**:
1. Check if invoice was created successfully:
   - Go to Invoices page in the app
   - Verify the invoice appears in the list

2. Check if notification code is running:
   - In Render logs, look for:
     `‚úÖ Notified X board members about new invoice`
   - If you don't see this, the notification code may not be running

3. Verify Render has latest code:
   - Go to GitHub repository
   - Check latest commit includes notification code
   - Go to Render ‚Üí **Manual Deploy** ‚Üí **Deploy latest commit**
